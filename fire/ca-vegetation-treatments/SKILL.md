# California Interagency Vegetation Treatments (ITS V2.0) Skill

## Description

This skill retrieves vegetation treatment activity records reported through the California Interagency Tracking System (ITS) by accessing the ArcGIS Feature Service at the following URL:

```
https://sparcal.sdsc.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Hosted/ITS_V2_0_Activity_webmap_gdb/FeatureServer/0
```

**Service Details:**
- Geographic coverage: **California only** (counties, regions, and ownership groups are CA-specific)
- Geometry type: Point (one point per activity record)
- Maximum record count per request: 2000 (pagination supported)
- Native spatial reference: EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator); the query function below sends `inSR=4326` (so the bbox is interpreted as WGS84) and `outSR=4326` (so results come back in WGS84). **Both must be set** — without `inSR=4326`, the server interprets the WGS84 bbox as Web Mercator coordinates and returns zero features.
- Total records: ~168,000 activities

The service returns the following columns:

- **objectid**: System-assigned unique identifier
- **agency**: Top-level reporting agency (coded — see below)
- **administering_org**: Sub-agency or organization administering the activity (coded — see below)
- **primary_ownership_group**: Land ownership category (coded — see below)
- **county**: California county code (3-letter; coded — see below)
- **region**: California vegetation region (coded — see below)
- **activity_description**: Free-text description of the treatment (e.g., "MOWING", "PRESCRIBED BURN")
- **activity_cat**: Activity category (coded — see below)
- **broad_vegetation_type**: Broad vegetation type at the treatment location (coded — see below)
- **activity_status**: Lifecycle status (coded — see below)
- **activity_quantity**: Numeric quantity of the activity
- **activity_uom**: Unit of measurement for `activity_quantity` (coded — see below)
- **activity_end**: Date the activity ended (epoch milliseconds; convert with `pd.to_datetime(..., unit='ms')`)
- **year_txt**: Year of the activity as text (e.g., "2023")
- **valid_geom**: Geometry validity flag (e.g., "VALID")
- **entity_type**: Reporting entity type (e.g., "State", "Federal")

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: All Categorical Fields Use Coded Values

Most filter-friendly fields store **short codes**, not human-readable names. Always query with the **code** (e.g., `county = 'LA'`, not `county = 'Los Angeles'`).

## When to Use

Use this skill to:

- Find vegetation treatment activities in a specific California county or region
- Query treatments by category (e.g., all prescribed fire activities, all timber harvests)
- Find treatments by administering organization (CAL FIRE, USFS, etc.)
- Filter treatments by ownership group, vegetation type, status, or year
- Compute total acres treated by category, county, or year
- Analyze the spatial distribution of vegetation treatment activities
- Find recent or upcoming planned treatments

## How to Use

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd
import requests
```

### Step 2: Define the Query Function

The service has a maximum of 2000 records per request and supports pagination via `resultOffset`. Use `get_all_features` (below) for queries that may return more than 2000 results.

```python
def get_features(service_url, where, bbox=None, max_records=2000):
    """
    Query the CA Interagency Vegetation Treatments Feature Service.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    service_url : str
        The URL of the ArcGIS Feature Service layer
    where : str
        SQL-like WHERE clause to filter features
    bbox : list or tuple, optional
        Bounding box as [minx, miny, maxx, maxy] in WGS84 (EPSG:4326).
        Defaults to California bounds.
    max_records : int, optional
        Maximum records to return in a single request (default: 2000)

    Returns:
    --------
    geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame containing treatment activity points in EPSG:4326

```

### Step 3: Query Examples

#### Example 1: All Activities in a County

```python
url = "https://sparcal.sdsc.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Hosted/ITS_V2_0_Activity_webmap_gdb/FeatureServer/0"

# All treatments in Los Angeles County
where = "county = 'LA'"
la_treatments = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Found {len(la_treatments)} treatment activities in Los Angeles County")
print(la_treatments[['activity_cat', 'activity_description', 'activity_quantity',
                     'activity_uom', 'year_txt']].head())
```

#### Example 2: All Prescribed Fire Activities Statewide

```python
# Prescribed fires across California
where = "activity_cat = 'PRESCRB_FIRE'"
prescribed_fires = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Found {len(prescribed_fires)} prescribed fire activities")

# Total acres burned (where unit is acres)
acres_burned = prescribed_fires[prescribed_fires['activity_uom'] == 'AC']['activity_quantity'].sum()
print(f"Total acres treated by prescribed fire: {acres_burned:,.0f}")
```

#### Example 3: Activities by a Specific Administering Org

```python
# All CAL FIRE activities
where = "administering_org = 'CALFIRE'"
calfire = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"CAL FIRE activities: {len(calfire)}")

# Breakdown by category
print(calfire['activity_cat'].value_counts())
```

#### Example 4: Recent Completed Activities (by year)

```python
# Completed activities in 2023
where = "activity_status = 'COMPLETE' AND year_txt = '2023'"
completed_2023 = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Completed in 2023: {len(completed_2023)} activities")

# Acres treated in 2023
acres_2023 = completed_2023[completed_2023['activity_uom'] == 'AC']['activity_quantity'].sum()
print(f"Total acres treated in 2023: {acres_2023:,.0f}")
```

#### Example 5: Mechanical Fuels Reduction in the Sierra Nevada

```python
# Mechanical/hand fuels reduction in Sierra Nevada region
where = "activity_cat = 'MECH_HFR' AND region = 'SIERRA_NEVADA'"
sierra_mech = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Mechanical fuels reduction in Sierra Nevada: {len(sierra_mech)} activities")

# By administering org
print(sierra_mech['administering_org'].value_counts().head(10))
```

#### Example 6: Treatments on Federal vs. State Land

```python
# All federal-land treatments in 2024
where = "primary_ownership_group = 'FEDERAL' AND year_txt = '2024'"
federal_2024 = get_all_features(url, where)

# All state-land treatments in 2024
where = "primary_ownership_group = 'STATE' AND year_txt = '2024'"
state_2024 = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"2024 federal-land treatments: {len(federal_2024)}")
print(f"2024 state-land treatments:   {len(state_2024)}")
```

#### Example 7: Forest Treatments in a Specific County

```python
# Forest treatments in Humboldt County
where = "county = 'HUM' AND broad_vegetation_type = 'FOREST'"
humboldt_forest = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Humboldt forest treatments: {len(humboldt_forest)}")
print(humboldt_forest[['activity_cat', 'activity_description',
                       'activity_quantity', 'activity_uom']].head(10))
```

#### Example 8: Multi-County Query

```python
# Treatments in any of three Bay Area counties
where = "county IN ('SCL', 'ALA', 'CC')"
bay_area = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Bay Area treatments: {len(bay_area)}")
print(bay_area['county'].value_counts())
```

#### Example 9: Activities Ending After a Specific Date

```python
# Activities that ended after Jan 1 2024
# Date fields use epoch-milliseconds; ArcGIS supports the TIMESTAMP literal
where = "activity_end >= TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01 00:00:00'"
recent = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Activities ending in/after 2024: {len(recent)}")

# Convert epoch ms to readable dates
recent['end_date'] = pd.to_datetime(recent['activity_end'], unit='ms')
print(recent[['activity_cat', 'activity_description', 'end_date']].head())
```

#### Example 10: Treatment Description Keyword Search

```python
# Free-text search in activity_description (e.g., find all "MOWING")
where = "activity_description LIKE '%MOWING%'"
mowing = get_all_features(url, where)

print(f"Mowing-related activities: {len(mowing)}")
print(mowing[['county', 'administering_org', 'activity_quantity', 'activity_uom']].head())
```

## Notes

### Geographic Scope: California Only

This dataset covers California exclusively. Counties, regions, and many administering organizations are CA-specific. The default bbox in `get_features` reflects this — there is no need to pass a bbox unless you want to narrow further (e.g., a single county).

### Spatial Reference

The service stores geometries in EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator), but the query function above requests `outSR=4326` so results come back in WGS84. No client-side transformation is needed.

### Coded Fields vs. Free-Text Fields

Most filter-friendly fields are **coded** (short codes like `'CALFIRE'`, `'PRESCRB_FIRE'`, `'LA'`). Use exact match (`=`) and the code, not the human-readable name. Two fields are free-text:

- `activity_description` — variable, often uppercase verbs (e.g., "MOWING", "PRESCRIBED BURN", "THINNING"). Use `LIKE '%KEYWORD%'` with uppercase.
- `valid_geom` — typically `'VALID'`; rarely useful as a filter.

### Activity Quantity and Unit of Measurement

The same dataset mixes units (acres, miles, hours, each, tons). When summing or comparing quantities, **always filter by `activity_uom` first**:

```python
# WRONG — mixes acres, miles, hours, etc.
total = df['activity_quantity'].sum()

# RIGHT — sum only acre values
acres = df[df['activity_uom'] == 'AC']['activity_quantity'].sum()
```

### Year Filtering

The `year_txt` field is a **string**, not an integer. Use string comparison:

```python
where = "year_txt = '2023'"          # OK
where = "year_txt IN ('2023', '2024')"  # OK
where = "year_txt >= '2020'"         # also works (lexicographic)
```

### Date Field Conversion

`activity_end` comes back as **epoch milliseconds** (e.g., `1693267200000`). Convert in pandas with:

```python
df['end_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['activity_end'], unit='ms')
```

For server-side date filtering use the ArcGIS `TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` literal as in Example 9.

### Pagination

The service caps each response at 2000 records, but the underlying dataset has ~168,000 records. Use `get_all_features` for any query that may return more than 2000 results (statewide queries, broad category queries, multi-year queries). The function pages through results automatically.

### WHERE Clause Tips

- **Always uppercase** for coded values: `"county = 'LA'"`, not `"county = 'la'"`
- **String literals in single quotes**: `"activity_cat = 'PRESCRB_FIRE'"`
- **Combine with AND/OR**: `"county = 'LA' AND activity_cat = 'PRESCRB_FIRE'"`
- **Multiple values**: `"county IN ('LA', 'ORA', 'SBD')"`
- **Free-text search**: `"activity_description LIKE '%MOWING%'"`
- **Numeric comparisons** for `activity_quantity`: `"activity_quantity > 100"`
- **All records**: `"1=1"` (use with a tighter bbox to avoid pulling all 168K records)

### Saving Output for Sage Display

When running inside Sage, save the queried GeoDataFrame as a GeoJSON file in `SAGE_OUTPUT_DIR`, then reference it in your markdown report using the standard `![Title](path/to/file.geojson)` map tag (see Sage's MAP RULE in the system prompt for combining layers).

```python
import os

outdir = globals().get("SAGE_OUTPUT_DIR", "/tmp")
os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)

# After the GeoDataFrame `df` is built:
out_path = os.path.join(outdir, "ca_vegetation_treatments.geojson")
df.to_file(out_path, driver="GeoJSON")
print(f"Saved {len(df)} records → {out_path}")
```

For categorical coloring on the map (e.g., color points by `activity_cat`), also save a colormap sidecar with the same base name plus `.colormap.json`:

```python
import json

colormap = {
    "field": "activity_cat",
    "title": "Activity Category",
    "palette": {
        "MECH_HFR":     "#fdb462",  # orange — Mech. & Hand Fuels Reduction
        "PRESCRB_FIRE": "#fb8072",  # red — Prescribed Fire
        "GRAZING":      "#b3de69",  # green — Targeted Grazing
        "TIMB_HARV":    "#80b1d3",  # blue — Timber Harvest
        "TREE_PLNTING": "#bebada",  # purple — Tree Planting
    },
}
with open(os.path.join(outdir, "ca_vegetation_treatments.colormap.json"), "w") as f:
    json.dump(colormap, f, indent=2)
```
